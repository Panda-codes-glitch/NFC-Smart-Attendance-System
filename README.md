# NFC Smart Attendance System using ESP32

## Overview
The NFC Smart Attendance System is an IoT-based solution designed to automate attendance recording using NFC-enabled ID cards.

The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller and a PN532 NFC module to detect NFC cards embedded in student ID cards. When a student taps their card, the system reads the card UID and records attendance automatically.

## Features
• Contactless attendance system  
• Fast NFC card scanning  
• LCD display for real-time feedback  
• LED and buzzer indication  
• WiFi-enabled system  
• Secure student identification  

## Hardware Components
- ESP32
